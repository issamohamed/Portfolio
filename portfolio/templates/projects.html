    <h3>Seer</h3>
    <div class="project-date">September 12, 2023</div>
  </div>
  <div class="project-description">
    <p>
      "Seer" is a AI web application I've been passionately developing, graciously inspired by recent strides in new public AI use cases, and I'm eager to walk you through its inner workings. At its core is "app.py," a Python script that serves as the project's foundation. It utilizes the Flask web framework to create a user-friendly interface. When you visit the project's main page, you'll be greeted by a supplmentary HTML template, "index2.html" that provides the interface for the User's entire experience.

    Here's where things get intriguing: you have the ability to record audio directly through your web browser. Once you've finished recording, the audio file is carefully saved as "sample_audio.webm" in a dedicated directory known as "uploads." But the real magic unfolds when the audio is handed over to "decipher.py."

    "decipher.py" is a Python module that takes on the crucial task of processing this audio input. It begins by verifying the existence of the uploaded audio file and then proceeds to load it into a specialized audio processing API developed by Openai called "Whisper". Whisper boasts impressive capabilities, including transcribing spoken words and natural language in any language within the audio, effectively converting audio into readable text.

    Seeing this, I decided to take a fascinating twist: The processed transcribed text Whisper converted is passed on to OpenAI's powerful GPT-3.5 Turbo model. In essence, think of Seer as a virtual middleman between these two highly capable AI processes, GPT-3.5's capabilities of generating profound responses based on the content of the audio Whisper already processesed from the user. To facilitate this interaction, the user simply simulates a conversation with Seer via a mic recording on their chrome browser. They send in their recorded audio, which is transcribed and responded to, allowing Seer to reply with insightful answers and commentary, akin to a fictional mystic revealing its wisdom.

    Seer's generated response along with the user's transcription is decoratively displayed on the web page thanks to some Javascript and CSS based built UI, making it easy for the user to engage in a dynamic conversation. Additionally, the user is able to also playback to hear the quality of their audio input alongside the AI's responses, which is presented in a gamelike chatbox with the wise mystic, providing a seamless and engaging user experience.

    <h3>Stock Price Fetcher</h3>
    <div class="project-date">January 8, 2023</div>
  </div>
  <div class="project-description">
    <p>
      This Java program allows users to retrieve the current stock price of any company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). It's a command-line application that interacts with the Alpha Vantage API to fetch real-time stock data.The program offers a user-friendly interface where users can enter the NYSE abbreviation of the desired stock. It validates the input, retrieves the stock price using the API, and displays it on the screen. Users can continue looking up stock prices for multiple stocks, with the option to exit the program at any time. During the development process, I faced a few challenges. One of the key challenges was integrating with the Alpha Vantage API and handling the JSON response returned by the API. I used the org.json library to parse the JSON data and extract the necessary information, such as the stock symbol and price. Another challenge was ensuring a smooth user experience and handling user input validation. I implemented error handling to handle cases where users input an invalid stock symbol or provide incorrect responses when prompted. Overall, the Stock Price Fetcher program provides a simple yet powerful tool for retrieving real-time stock prices.

    <h3>ATM Machine</h3>
    <div class="project-date">December 24, 2022</div>
  </div>
  <div class="project-description">
    <p>
      This project is a user-friendly Java application that emulates the functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). With this program, one can effortlessly check their account balance, withdraw funds, deposit funds, and exit the system. To use this specific program, one must compile with the command “javac ATM.java” before running, ensuring they have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. Upon launching the program, a menu is displayed, presenting options for checking one’s account balance, withdrawing funds, depositing funds, and exiting. By selecting option 1, one can quickly check their account balance, which will be displayed on the screen. Additionally, option 2 allows one to withdraw funds by entering the desired withdrawal amount. The program verifies that the amount is within one’s available balance and provides a success message upon a valid withdrawal. In case of insufficient funds, an appropriate error message is shown. For depositing funds, one can choose option 3 and input the desired deposit amount. Accordingly, the program in turn, adds the deposited amount to your current balance and displays a success message. Lastly, if the user selects option 4, the system exits gracefully, displaying a final farewell message. Overall, this project was a great opportunity for me to get familiar with and practice try catching and exception handling.

      <h3>Connect 4</h3>
      <div class="project-date">November 24, 2021</div>
    </div>
    <div class="project-description">
      <p>
        As an avid lover of classic games, for a class project, I embarked on a thrilling project to create my own rendition of "Connect Four" in Python. To bring this game to life, I harnessed the power of the Tkinter module, a popular graphical user interface library, and augmented it with my custom graphics library, aptly named "pgl". Through careful design and meticulous coding, I managed to strike a good balance between aesthetics and functionality, resulting in an immersive and captivating gaming experience. With a few deft clicks of the mouse, players can strategically place their moves on a sleek and graphical game board, with each move triggering a cascade of events as the game state is dynamically updated. To provide an engaging challenge, I implemented a formidable bot opponent armed with a repertoire of clever strategies. This AI adversary carefully evaluates the game state and executes cunning maneuvers to thwart the player's paths to victory. Additionally, behind the scenes, my code quickly tracks every move, cataloging player choices, bot counteractions, and the remaining open spots on the board. Leveraging this wealth of information, I was able to painstakingly engineer an intelligent win-condition checker, capable of swiftly identifying when a player triumphs over their opponent or when the game ends in a draw. Overall, this project provided a great learning experience regarding how to tackle dynamic and conditional event handling.

      <h3>Sudoku Solver</h3>
      <div class="project-date">December 3, 2022</div>
    </div>
    <div class="project-description">
      <p>
        Growing up, I never fared well against Sudoku Puzzles. Inspired by this shortcoming, I began the development of “The Sudoku Solver”, a small project that uses a backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles. By systematically exploring number combinations for each empty cell and adhering to Sudoku rules, the solver efficiently finds the optimal solution. It starts by identifying empty cells and tries numbers from 1 to 9, ensuring their validity in rows, columns, and 3x3 grids. If a number is invalid, it backtracks and explores alternative options. This process continues until the puzzle is solved or deemed unsolvable. The Sudoku Solver is a valuable tool for Sudoku enthusiasts and developers interested in algorithmic problem-solving, offering an enjoyable and efficient way to conquer Sudoku challenges.
